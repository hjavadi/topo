    "Now that we understand the topological transition in more detail, let's go back to the bulk Hamiltonian $H(k)$ of the Kitaev ring and try to generalize our Dirac-equation based criterion for Majorana modes. In our effective Dirac model it was easy to identify a quantity, the mass parameter $m$, whose sign determined whether the system could support unpaired Majorana modes at its ends. Let's now try to turn this effective description into a **bulk topological invariant** which can be computed directly from $H(k)$. We will not attempt to give a rigorous derivation of the bulk invariant - a task which is often difficult even for advanced researchers in the field - but rather to arrive at it in a heuristic manner.\n",

    "We can start with some important clues. On the one hand, we are studying a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian, and we have already learned that quantum dots with particle-hole symmetry are characterized by a topological invariant, the sign of the Pfaffian, which changes sign at every gap closing. On the other hand, we have just seen that the gap closing in the Kitaev chain model is accompanied by a change of sign of $m$. This suggests to try to link the quantity $m$ to a Pfaffian. How to do so?\n",

    "In fact, you can think of the full $H_\\textrm{BdG}$ as a very large matrix with particle-hole symmetry. It can be put in antisymmetric form and we can compute its Pfaffian. This Pfaffian may change only when an eigenvalue of $H(k)$ passes through zero. Because of particle-hole symmetry, for every eigenvalue $E(k)$ we have one at $-E(-k)$. So if $E(k)$ passes through zero, also its partner does. Furthermore, the spectrum has to be periodic in the Brillouin zone, which means that gap closings at finite momentum always come in pairs, and cannot change the Pfaffian. There are only two points which make exception: $k=0$ and $k=\\pi$, which are mapped onto themselves by particle-hole symmetry. In fact, for these points we have:\n",
